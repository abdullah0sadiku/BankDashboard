## Features

### Homepage1 (/homepage1)
- Light theme with purple/blue color scheme

## Key Data Points for Scraping

Both dashboard versions include consistent data points for scraper testing:

- Card details
- Current balance
- Income/expense totals
- Transaction history
- User profile information
- Quick actions
